# Prog-paralela
This repository contains two files that implement parallel matrix multiplication using different approaches with nested loops. Below is a brief description of the files and their features:

## File: multiplication_matrices_3loops.c
This file implements parallel matrix multiplication using 3 nested loops. The program divides the task of multiplying matrices into smaller sub-tasks and assigns them to different threads to leverage the parallel processing capabilities of the computer. The file includes explanatory comments to facilitate code understanding.

## File: multiplication_matrices_6loops.c
This file implements parallel matrix multiplication using 6 nested loops. The 6-loop approach allows for a further subdivision of the task into smaller sub-tasks, which can result in a better workload distribution among threads. The file also includes explanatory comments to aid in code comprehension.
